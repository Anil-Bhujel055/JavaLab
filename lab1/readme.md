# Introduction to Data types and Arrays

>Theory:

## Data types:
Data types are the attributes of data which tells the compiler or interpreterthe programmer intends to use the data.

There are mainly two types of data in Java:
	- Primitive Data Type
	- Nom-Primitive Data Type

Examples:
boolean,integer,float,string,array etc.


>Compiling Java Program:
After installing JDK we get which contains compiler to compile the java files.

>Execution of programs:
We use "Java ClassName" in order to run the Java file which have been already compiled and has classfile.
Inorder for file to run,it (or the class ) must contain a "public static void main(String[] a)"function.

## Array:

An array is a type of data that can hold more than one data of same type within asame variable name.
eg:
int[] array = new int[size_of_array];// it creates an array of integer type of size (size_of_array)

Array can be of two types:

1. One dimensional array:
Simple array with a list of items or data is called One dimensional array.


2. Multi-dimensional array:
Array with rows and columns of items or data is multi-dimensional array.
eg:
int[][] x = new int[3][5];
// it creates an array with 3 rows and 5 columns.

* Anonymous Array:

The array which doesnot have any name is called Anonymous Array.

- Anonymous array is used for one time purpose only and mainly passed as an arguement of method.
